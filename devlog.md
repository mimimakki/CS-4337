I will be creating a prefix-notation expression calculator using Racket. The user will be prompted to input an expression in prefix-notation, and my program will calculate the result
and output it to the user. The calculator will contain a history feature, where previous (and successful) calculations will be kept and stored. The program will also handle potential
errors.
