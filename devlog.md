I will be creating a prefix-notation expression calculator using Racket. The user will be prompted to input an expression in prefix-notation, and my program will calculate the result
and output it to the user. The calculator will contain a history feature, where previous (and successful) calculations will be kept and stored. The program will also handle potential
errors.

So far, I have included the code the professor has provided for the program to be run either in batch or interactive mode. I have also created a function to parse the input from user.

I have renamed the function "parse-input" to "process-tokens" for naming clarity purposes. I also simplified it and added more comments for readability purposes. I created a new function to tokenize the input which handles each case for the calculator. Next, I need to evaluate the expression using the tokens.
