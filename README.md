Using a cs1 or cs2 machine, enter the command ```racket Project.rkt``` to run the program. To use batch mode, enter the same command followed by ```-b``` or ```--batch```. 
Otherwise, the program is automatically run in interactive mode. Enter an expression in prefix-notation, and the calculator will automatically output the result. A history of previous results will be stored. 
Each result can be recalled via '$' followed by the history id. If the input is invalid, an error message will be displayed. 
To exit the program, simply input "quit".
